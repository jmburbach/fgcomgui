Scons is used for building and install FGComGui. Currently the SConstruct build
script should work without modifications on Ubuntu based systems. Others may
need to adjust some of the paths to fit there system, sorry, this will be fixed
soon.

FGComGui's only dependancy is Qt4, you will need the Qt4 development package(s).

To build run
$ scons

To see build arguments run
$ scons --help

To set installation prefix (default is /usr/local)
$ scons prefix=/some/other/prefix

To install
$ sudo scons install

To uninstall
$ sudo scons -c install


Build arguments are cached in config.py, delete this file to reset to defaults.
