						<p>FGCom is a virtual radio software built on top of voip using Asterisk.
						FGCom and FlightGear are two completely independant programs, but they work together
						to bring realistic radio communication your FlightGear session. Using FlightGear's
						generic protocol framework FGCom is able to receive information about your flightgear
						session, such as when you keyed the mic to talk and your position on earth.
						<br /><br />
						FGCom is currently implemented as a command line only program, it has no graphical interface,
					   	it must be started and configured from the shell window. While this is not a bad thing,
						some find it difficult to understand or unfriendly to use. FGComGui attempts to change this by 
						creating a simple GUI frontend to FGCom, making usage a simple point and click operation.</p>

					<h2>The FGComGui window</h2>
					<div class="sectionbody">
						<img src="images/fgcomgui.png" />
						<h3>Settings can only be modifed before fgcom is started.</h3>
						<ol type="A">
							<li>Your standard file menu. Currently it contains only one item, to exit the application</li>
							<li>There are two modes, the normal mode used with flightgear, and a test mode. In the test
							mode everything you say will be echoed back to you, allowing you to check that everything is
							working and volumes are good.</li>
							<li>Here you can enter the name or full path to the fgcom executable. Pressing the button to
						   	the right will open a file browser. This does not normally need to be changed.</li>
							<li>Slider to adjust your input(recording) volume</li>
							<li>Slider to adjust your output(playback) volume</li>
							<li>Start button, pressing this to start fgcom</li>
							<li>Stop button, press this to stop fgcom</li>
							<li>Messages from fgcom will be displayed here</li>
						</ol>
						<br />
						<p>FGComGui will display an icon in the system tray. Closing the window will not exit the application,
						but hide it instead. You can show/hide the window by clicking the tray icon. To exit the application
						use the File menu, or right click the tray icon and select Quit.</p>

					<h2>Configuring FlightGear</h2>
					<div class="sectionbody">
						<p>To do anything useful FGCom needs information from FlightGear, such as position, radio frequency,
						and when you keyed the mic. To get this information FGCom uses FlightGear's generic protocol framework, 
						which we need to setup. This is a simple procedure, and only needs to be done once.<p>
						<br />
						<p>Start by opening the FlightGear wizard(fgrun). On the fourth page of the wizard, you will see a button
						marked advanced like below.</p>
						
						<img src="images/fgwizard_advanced.png" />

						<p>Pressing the advanced button will open a new window. In the list to the left of this window, select
						Input/Output. Press the New button to add a new entry, and then configure the options to match the
					   	image below. When finished, press Ok.</p>

						<img src="images/fgwizard_generic_fgcom.png" />

						<p>That's all that needs to be configured. Now when FlightGear and FGCom are running, they will be able
						to communicate with each other. Tuning your radio in FlightGear will set the frequency for FGCom, and
						pressing the push-to-talk key(default is spacebar), FGCom will transmit what you say on that frequency. It 
						does not matter what order FlightGear and FGCom are started, as long as they are both running. Enjoy!</p>
